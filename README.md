# Python Projects Collection

This repository is a collection of Python projects I've built while exploring different ideas and tools. It includes a mix of fun, utility, and learning-based mini projects â€” from simple games to voice-powered apps.

Some of the highlights in this repo are a to-do list app with GUI, a unit converter, guessing games, and even a basic grocery tool with voice interaction. Alongside these, you'll also find AI-based projects like a personal assistant and bot-related tools, which make this collection even more exciting and practical.

These projects helped me understand core concepts of Python like file handling, GUI with Tkinter, conditionals, logic building, and integrating voice and AI features.

This repo is all about learning, experimenting, and building cool stuff along the way.

Feel free to check out the code and give feedback if youâ€™d like ðŸ™‚
